# schelling_models
This Repository was created to begin exploration of Andrew Lewis Pye's proof based analysis of the models. However, after initial exploration, the project has morphed into my work of the Asexual and Sexual Replication question (https://github.com/saroyas/Asexual-Sexual_reproduction) - where I explore the queen of biological question:: Why does sexual replication exist despite it's apparent deficencies.

Exploring Schelling models through simulations
In 1971, the American economist Thomas Schelling created an agent-based model that might help explain why segregation is so difficult to combat. His model of segregation showed that even when individuals (or "agents") didn't mind being surrounded or living by agents of a different race, they would still choose to segregate themselves from other agents over time! Although the model is quite simple, it gives a fascinating look at how individuals might self-segregate, even when they have no explicit desire to do so. It also has direct links to areas at the interface between computer science and statistical mechanics, such as the Ising model and the study of contagion and cascading phenomena in networks.

I've left the python code for the 1D and 2D scheling cases up here in the hope that it will help someone else quickly get their simulations up and running.
